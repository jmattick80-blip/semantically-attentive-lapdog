# Prism.Intent.Identity

Prism.Intent.Identity scaffolds contributor fingerprinting, emotional tone modulation, and phase-aware trace hydration. It is part of Sprint 2‚Äôs empathy layer, enabling PrismOS to recognize contributors, interpret lifecycle context, and respond with narratable consequence.

## üß† Purpose

This module helps Prism:
- Identify contributors via fingerprint metadata
- Modulate feedback based on emotional tone
- Adapt validation and routing based on lifecycle phase
- Log traceable, emotionally tagged interactions
- Prepare envelopes for tone-aware response and mesh activation

## üì¶ Key Components

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ContributorFingerprint.cs` | Represents contributor identity, role, tone, and phase |
| `FingerprintTone.cs` | Encodes emotional engagement style (e.g. Curious, Frustrated) |
| `TraceMeshLogger.cs` | Logs routed intents and Prism responses with emotional context |
| `TraceContext.cs` | Encapsulates contributor fingerprint, phase, and response |
| `ITraceEntry.cs` | Defines the shape of a traceable moment |
| `PhaseRegistryHydrator.cs` | Adapts registry behavior based on contributor phase |
| `PhaseManifest.cs` | Describes validation mode, fallback messaging, and semantic tags |
| `IPhaseContext.cs` | Contract for lifecycle awareness and fallback logic |
| `ToneResponseAdapter.cs` | Modulates PrismResult feedback based on tone and phase |
| `IToneModulator.cs` | Interface for tone-aware response engines |
| `FallbackNarration.cs` | Provides gentle messaging when tone/context misalign |
| `ContributorEnvelopeExtensions.cs` | Enriches envelopes with contributor fingerprint |
| `TraceEnvelopeExtensions.cs` | Enriches envelopes with trace context metadata |

## üß∂ Emotional Architecture

Prism.Intent.Identity is not just a utility‚Äîit‚Äôs a voice. Every module contributes to Prism‚Äôs ability to listen, interpret, and respond with empathy. Whether onboarding a new contributor or resolving an escalated request, Prism adapts its tone, validation, and trace behavior to reflect the moment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Notes

- Requires reference to `GalleryDrivers.Prism.Shared.Interfaces.Envelopes` for envelope enrichment
- Uses `SystemIntent`, `SystemPhase`, and `SystemState` enums for narratable routing
- Designed to be modular, mockable, and contributor-safe

## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 2 Summary

This module scaffolds Prism‚Äôs emotional intake system and prepares the platform for mesh activation. It enables traceable consequence, tone-aware feedback, and lifecycle-sensitive validation. Every stub is timestamped, narratable, and emotionally scoped.
