ðŸ§  Prism.Intent.Interpretation
This namespace powers Prism OSâ€™s emotional interpretation layer. It transforms contributor fingerprints, tone history, and trace logs into narratable, emotionally legible feedback. Designed for simulation-grade consequence, it supports NPC emitters, designer-authored responses, and mesh replayability.
