# Prism.Intent.Interpretation

## ðŸ§  Overview
Prism.Intent.Interpretation is the emotional modulation layer of Prism OS. It interprets contributor input, applies tone consequence, and generates narratable feedback. This project bridges raw semantic intent with emotionally legible response logic, enabling Prism to speak with empathy, consequence, and clarity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Interpret contributor input using authored manifests and emotional context
- Apply tone consequence via modulation engines and response narrators
- Store contributor memory for adaptive feedback and traceable consequence
- Build mesh clusters for replay, trace hydration, and emotional routing

## ðŸ§© Internal Role in Prism
| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| Config | Defines interpretation manifests and tone consequence mappings |
| Interfaces | Strategy contracts for interpretation logic |
| Memory | Stores contributor memory for adaptive feedback |
| Response | Narrates feedback and applies tone consequence |
| Trace | Builds mesh clusters and supports replayable emotional memory |

## ðŸ§­ Key Components
- `InterpretationManifest.cs`: Defines how Prism interprets contributor input
- `ToneConsequenceEngine.cs`: Modulates feedback based on contributor tone
- `ResponseNarrator.cs`: Generates narratable, emotionally legible responses
- `ContributorMemoryStore.cs`: Tracks contributor interactions for adaptive consequence
- `MeshClusterBuilder.cs`: Groups traceable moments into emotional clusters
- `MeshReplayEngine.cs`: Supports replayable mesh hydration and consequence review

## ðŸ§¹ Sprint 5 Audit Plan
We will:
- Audit each file for purpose, emotional scope, and runtime relevance
- Remove unused scaffolds and legacy stubs
- Document onboarding notes and narratable summary regions
- Ensure every component contributes to emotional consequence and prefab safety
