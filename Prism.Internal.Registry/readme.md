# Prism.Internal.Registry

## 🧠 Overview
Prism.Internal.Registry manages session-scoped entity transformation, consequence routing, and emotional governance. It applies transformer pipelines, evaluates trait-based scenario triggers, and commits session state with traceable metadata.

This module anchors Prism’s multiplayer-safe simulation logic—where contributor actions ripple into narratable consequence and prefab-safe feedback.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Transform contributor entities using mood, trait, and overlay pipelines
- Validate payloads and apply scenario triggers
- Commit session state with emotional trace and metadata flattening
- Generate narratable feedback using `PrismIntentResultFactory`
- Debug trait map activation through a single consequence flow

## 🧩 Internal Role in Prism
| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `RegistryAdapter` | Applies transformations and commits session state |
| `PrismIntentResultFactory` | Centralizes prefab-safe result generation |
| `SessionMetadata` | Captures session lifecycle, curator identity, and snapshot IDs |
| `Logs/` | (Planned) Emotional trace and ripple consequence history |

## 🧭 Sprint 5 Updates
- ✅ `CommitSession(...)` refactored and emotionally scoped
- ❌ Not yet invoked in runtime—currently dormant
- ✅ Trait map debugging now centralized in commit flow
- ✅ Result generation routed through `PrismIntentResultFactory`
- 🟡 Persistence of `SessionMetadata` pending
