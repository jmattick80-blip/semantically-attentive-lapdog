# Prism.Internal.Shared.MeshLogic

## ðŸ§  Overview
Prism.Internal.Shared.MeshLogic is the abstraction layer for Prismâ€™s emotional mesh. It defines shared interfaces, routing logic, and consequence calculation strategies that guide how internal mesh engines propagate mood, score ripple impact, and activate traits.

This module ensures that mesh behavior remains narratable, extensible, and genre-safeâ€”whether used in runtime engines, simulation overrides, or contributor-specific modulation flows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Define mesh behavior contracts for propagation, scoring, and activation
- Route emotional consequence across mesh layers and contributor profiles
- Calculate ripple impact and trait activation based on modulated deltas
- Enable plug-in mesh logic for genre-safe simulation and multiplayer consequence

## ðŸ§© Internal Role in Prism
| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `Interfaces/IMeshPropagator.cs` | Guides propagation logic across mesh layers |
| `Interfaces/IRippleScorer.cs` | Calculates emotional consequence from mesh impact |
| `Interfaces/ITraitActivator.cs` | Triggers traits based on ripple signals |
| `Interfaces/IMeshRouter.cs` | (Planned) Routes mesh signals across simulation layers |
| `Interfaces/IMeshResistanceProfile.cs` | Applies resistance or dampening to propagation |

## ðŸ”— Relationship to Prism.Internal.Mesh
- `Internal.Mesh` executes runtime propagation and consequence
- `Shared.MeshLogic` defines the contracts and routing strategies
- Future integration will allow `MeshEngine` to resolve shared logic dynamically

## ðŸ”§ Expanded Role in Prism

In addition to defining mesh behavior interfaces, `Shared.MeshLogic` serves as a home for mesh-aware utilities and consequence routing logic that may be needed by:

- **Processors** â€“ for trait activation, ripple scoring, or mesh-layer consequence evaluation
- **Registries** â€“ for interpreting mesh impact during session commit or rollback
- **Narrators** â€“ for tone modulation and emotional feedback generation

This module allows Prism to reason about mesh consequence without invoking full runtime propagationâ€”making it ideal for preview flows, audit tools, and multiplayer-safe consequence scaffolding.

## ðŸ§­ Sprint 5 Status
- âœ… Interfaces folder scaffolded
- ðŸŸ¡ No implementations yetâ€”awaiting integration with `MeshEngine`
- ðŸŸ¡ Ready for routing logic, ripple scoring, and trait activation strategies
