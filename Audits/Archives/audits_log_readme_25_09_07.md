# 🧾 Prism OS – Audit Archive

📅 **Finalized:** Sprint 5 – September 7, 2025  
✍️ **Auditor:** Jeremy M. – Prism Architect  
📁 **Folder:** `/audits`  
📦 **Scope:** Full system audit across all Prism projects

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This folder contains the complete audit archive for Prism OS. Each project has been narratively reviewed for emotional consequence, contributor safety, and architectural clarity. Dormant modules are flagged, active components are scoped, and future extensibility is preserved.

---

## ✅ Projects Audited

- `Prism.Shared.Contracts`
- `Prism.Unity.Bridge`
- `Prism.Intent.Gateway`
- `Prism.Internal.Mesh`
- `Prism.Internal.Registry`
- `Prism.Internal.Shared.MeshLogic`
- `Prism.Internals.DataManager`
- `Prism.Internals.Globals`
- `Prism.Internals.Orchestration`
- `Prism.Internals.Processor`
- `Prism.IO.Input`

Each project includes its own `README.md` inside this folder, documenting:

- Component status (Active, Dormant, Stubbed, Deprecated)
- Emotional consequence and contributor traceability
- Recommendations for activation, refactor, or removal
- Prefab safety and future-facing scaffolds

---

## 🧩 Emotional Consequence

This audit preserves the emotional mesh of Prism OS. Contributors can trace every trait, token, and transformation. Dormant modules are scaffolded with intent, and every decision is narratable.

---

## ✨ Final Notes

- Constants migrated to `Globals`
- Trait modulation and replay scaffolds flagged for activation
- Session overloads scoped for delegation
- Unity bridge confirmed adapter-safe and prefab-ready
