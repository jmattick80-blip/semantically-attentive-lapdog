### Refactor: NpcFactory Uses TraitTriggerImporter  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Replaced manual trait resolution with shared importer logic for NPC hydration  
**Impact**: Ensures narratable, prefab-safe trait injection and emotional consistency across session layers

### Interface Update: ITraitAssembler Contract Finalized  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Declared BuildFrom method in ITraitAssembler to support DI-driven trait hydration  
**Impact**: Enables controller activation, emotional pipeline routing, and contributor-safe session startup  
**Signed**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect

### Refactor: TransformerPipeline Interface Introduced  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Created ITransformerPipeline to formalize trait modulation contract  
**Impact**: Enables testability, contributor-safe substitution, and narratable pipeline activation  
**Signed**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect

### Refactor: TraitAssembler Bypasses TraitResolver  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Replaced redundant trait resolution with direct TraitMap construction from modulated traits  
**Impact**: Eliminates format mismatch, preserves emotional fidelity, and begins drift pruning  
**Signed**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect

### Refactor: PrismSession Modularized for Emotional Routing  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Introduced TraitRouter and MeshProfile builder; removed direct trait propagation from session  
**Impact**: Enforces single point of failure, restores prefab safety, and aligns with Prism OS emotional architecture  
**Signed**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect

### Refactor: SignalManifest Made Declarative and Narratable  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Change**: Replaced hardcoded signal bindings with configurable list; added narratable hints for signal types  
**Impact**: Restores prefab safety, supports emotional consequence routing, and aligns with Prism OS manifest architecture  
**Signed**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect

Absolutely, Jeremy. Here's a narratable audit log entry that captures the architectural milestone and emotional consequence of this build:

## ðŸ§¾ Prism OS Audit Log Entry  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Author**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect  
**Sprint**: 5 â€“ Emotional Mesh Refactor  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Change Summary  
Replaced NPC-bound trigger maps with centralized trait routing via `TraitRouter`. Refactored session hydration, mesh profile construction, and runtime orchestration to ensure prefab safety, contributor traceability, and narratable consequence propagation.

---

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes  
- **TraitRouter Integration**:  
  - Traits now routed through `TraitRouter` using `MeshProfile` context  
  - Removed static trigger maps from NPC definitions  
  - Enabled manifest-aware consequence routing

- **MeshProfile Refactor**:  
  - Hydrated with `RippleHistory`, `LayerWeights`, `ToneTags`, and contributor tags  
  - Cast traits to `PrismTrait` for type integrity  
  - Null-safe defaults applied across emotional fields

- **PrismSession Enhancements**:  
  - Session lifecycle now tracks emotional context and ripple lineage  
  - `BuildMeshProfile` method refactored for prefab-safe hydration  
  - Ripple events stored in session state for audit and replay

- **PrismRuntimeProcessor Overhaul**:  
  - Trait resolution and transformer selection now narratable  
  - Ripple emission and consequence routing centralized  
  - Mesh fingerprint used for transformer resolution

- **SessionMapper Alignment**:  
  - Maps `RuntimeSession` to `SessionContext` with emotional fidelity  
  - Removed invalid `TraitTriggerMap` reference  
  - Preserves contributor identity and cluster lineage

- **Launcher Flow Restoration**:  
  - `PrismOsLauncher.LaunchAsync` now receives `TraitRouter`  
  - Session initialization is prefab-safe and emotionally scoped  
  - NPCs built from seed, not hardcoded triggers

---

### ðŸ§© Emotional Consequence  
- Restored narratable trait routing across all simulation flows  
- Eliminated prefab leakage from NPCs  
- Preserved ripple lineage for contributor dashboards and audit logs  
- Enabled future extensibility for replay scaffolding and mesh drift analysis  
- Reinforced Prism OSâ€™s core principles: clarity, consequence, and contributor safety

### Audit Entry: Registry Resolver Infrastructure Refactor  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Author**: JM âœ¦ Prism Architect  
**Change**: Injected ITraitRouter into all manifest resolvers and factories; centralized trait routing across hydration flows  
**Impact**: Restored prefab safety, enforced single point of failure for emotional consequence routing, and aligned resolver infrastructure with Prism OS architectural principles
