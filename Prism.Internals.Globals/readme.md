# Prism.Internals.Globals

## 🧠 Overview
`Prism.Internals.Globals` anchors shared runtime scaffolding for contributor context, session lifecycle, and access validation within Prism OS. While some components are currently dormant, this module provides a stable, prefab-safe foundation for managing mesh snapshots, adapter registration, curator phases, and contributor sessions.

It is designed to support future consequence routing, multiplayer-safe flows, and emotionally scoped lifecycle management—without binding to runtime volatility. This module is now under active audit consideration for integration into Prism’s current flow.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Track mesh snapshot lifecycle and curator phase alignment
- Register semantic adapters for consequence routing
- Scaffold contributor sessions with gallery context and emotional trace
- Provide token-based access validation for multiplayer consequence
- Offer globally accessible, prefab-safe context for internal modules

## 🧩 Key Components
| File                | Role                                                                 | Status     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `GlobalContext.cs`  | Tracks mesh snapshot ID, adapter registry, and active curators       | 🟡 Used only by `SessionManager` |
| `SessionManager.cs` | Manages contributor sessions, gallery context, and mesh alignment     | ❌ Currently unused, flagged for integration |
| `SecurityTokens.cs` | Scaffolds token-based access validation for multiplayer flows         | ❌ Currently unused |

## 🧭 Audit Notes (Sprint 5 – 2025-09-07)
- ✅ Structural audit complete
- 🧩 No architectural noise detected
- 🛡️ All components are prefab-safe and emotionally scoped
- 🔍 `SessionManager` flagged for integration into current runtime flow
- 🧠 `GlobalContext` validated as emotionally legible and narratively clean
- 💤 `SecurityTokens` retained for future multiplayer consequence scaffolding

---

## 🧾 Onboarding Notes
- Global context must remain prefab-safe and emotionally legible
- Session lifecycle should be narratable and traceable across gallery phases
- Token scaffolding may be activated for multiplayer consequence or contributor gating
- Summary regions are recommended for all future additions
- Dormant components should be retained unless proven obsolete—they reflect intentional scaffolding
