# Prism.Shared.Contracts

üì¶ **Purpose**  
Prism.Shared.Contracts defines the foundational interfaces, trait scaffolds, session types, and emotional mesh artifacts used across Prism OS. This project ensures contributor-safe interoperability between runtime systems, simulation scaffolds, and emotional consequence engines.

---

## üß† Architectural Role

- Acts as the **contract layer** between simulation modules, orchestrators, and mesh processors
- Provides **prefab-safe trait definitions** and emotional modulation interfaces
- Enables **session traceability**, contributor onboarding, and replay scaffolding
- Centralizes **intent, tone, and trait routing** for runtime consequence modeling

---

## üß© Key Components

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Traits` | Modular, narratable traits used for filtering, modulation, and emotional consequence |
| `Sessions` | Session scaffolds including `PrismSession`, `SessionContext`, and `SessionEntityState` |
| `Tone` | Contributor tone adapters and authored response manifests |
| `Intent` | Intent manifests and resolution contracts |
| `Envelopes` | Payload wrappers for emotional routing and trait propagation |
| `Fingerprint` | Contributor identity and tone fingerprinting |
| `TraceLogs` | Optional scaffolds for emotional traceability and replay diagnostics |

---

## üß¨ Emotional Mesh Integration

- TraitTriggerImporter hydrates trait maps from NPCs and payloads
- TraitAssembler (currently dormant) transforms triggers into narratable trait bundles
- ToneResponseManifest stores designer-authored emotional feedback
- IToneModulator enables tone-aware consequence modulation
- SessionTokenRouter (dormant) hints at global registry routing via session tokens

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributor Notes

- Many classes are **scaffolded but dormant**‚Äîintended for future consequence routing
- Trait modulation and replay scaffolding are **partially implemented**
- Constants should be migrated to the `Globals` project for prefab clarity
- Trait usage is uneven; audit logs flag dormant traits for future activation

## üßæ Audit Summary

This project has been fully reviewed as of **Sprint 5 ‚Äì September 7, 2025**.  
All dormant modules have been flagged, and active components are narratively scoped.  
Ready for handoff or integration into runtime orchestration and mesh replay layers.
