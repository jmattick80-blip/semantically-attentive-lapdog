ðŸ“˜ README: Prism Envelope Validators
Overview
Prismâ€™s envelope validation system ensures that every intent routed through the mesh is narratable, contributor-safe, and emotionally legible. Validators attach tone, context, and fallback notes to each envelope, enabling traceable feedback and audit clarity.
Components

| EnvelopeValidatorBase |  |
| DefaultEnvelopeValidator |  |
| EnvelopeValidatorDescriptor |  |
| EnvelopeValidatoryRegistry |  |


Flow Summary
- Envelope is routed to a validator via EnvelopeValidatoryRegistry.GetForContext(contextId)
- If a descriptor is registered, its Factory creates a validator instance
- If not, DefaultEnvelopeValidator is inflated with context-aware fallback notes
- Validator adds narratable notes to the envelope via AddNotes()
- Notes can be surfaced in logs, dashboards, or replay summaries
  Emotional Consequence
  Validators are the emotional editors of Prismâ€™s runtime. They ensure every envelope is reviewed with tone, context, and contributor clarityâ€”even when the system doesnâ€™t know whoâ€™s watching.
