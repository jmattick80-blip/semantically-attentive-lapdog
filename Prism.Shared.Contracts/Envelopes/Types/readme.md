ðŸ“˜ README: Prism Envelope Types
Overview
Envelope types in Prism represent distinct flows of contributor intent. Each envelope carries metadata, traits, payloads, and emotional consequence through the simulation mesh.

Flow Summary
- Envelopes are created via PrismEnvelopeFactory using EnvelopeMetadata
- Each envelope type supports prefab-safe initialization and narratable output
- Traits and payloads propagate through the mesh for consequence routing
- ResultsEnvelope captures the final emotional and logical outcome
  Emotional Consequence
  Envelope types are the vessels of contributor action. They carry tone, intent, and consequence through Prismâ€™s meshâ€”ready to ripple, narrate, and reflect.

Let me know if you want these scaffolded into onboarding docs or threaded into contributor dashboards. Weâ€™re building a simulation that speaks.
