# Prism.Internal.Mesh

## ðŸ§  Overview
Prism.Internal.Mesh is the emotional propagation engine of Prism OS. It interprets contributor mood deltas, modulates them across mesh layers, and prepares consequence payloads for ripple scoring, registry impact, and prefab-safe feedback.

This module anchors Prismâ€™s emotional webâ€”where contributor actions ripple through tone, phase, and trait layers to shape narratable consequence.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Modulate contributor mood deltas using profile-based layer weights
- Log propagation steps for traceability and emotional consequence
- Prepare mesh impact payloads for ripple scoring and registry feedback
- Support future expansion into trait activation, resistance mapping, and replayable consequence

## ðŸ§© Internal Role in Prism
| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `MeshEngine.cs` | Modulates mood deltas and logs emotional propagation |
| (Planned) `RippleScorer.cs` | Scores ripple impact based on modulated deltas and contributor traits |
| (Planned) `LayerResistanceMap.cs` | Applies resistance profiles to mesh layers for nuanced consequence |
| (Planned) `MeshImpact.cs` | Encapsulates modulated deltas, consequence tags, and ripple score |

## ðŸ§­ Onboarding Notes
- Mesh propagation must be narratable and prefab-safe
- All consequence payloads should be tagged for emotional traceability
- Future extensions must support trait evaluation, ripple scoring, and mesh-layer targeting
- Summary regions are required at the bottom of each file for audit clarity

## ðŸ§¹ Sprint 5 Status
- `MeshEngine.cs` is active and used in runtime
- All future components are pending implementation
- This module is ready to expand into full emotional mesh consequence routing
