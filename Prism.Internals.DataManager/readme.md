# DataManager

**Prism OS Module**  
_Audited for modularity, emotional consequence, and contributor clarity_

---

## Overview

`DataManager` is a modular runtime component within Prism OS, responsible for orchestrating data flow, hydration, and mesh-safe access across simulation layers. It interprets semantic intent and ensures contributor-safe routing of traits, identities, and emotional payloads.

This module has been audited for:
- 🧩 Modular clarity and prefab safety
- 🌊 Emotional consequence in data propagation
- 🛡️ Contributor-safe onboarding and fallback narration

---

## Key Responsibilities

- **Trait Routing**: Ensures semantic traits are routed with emotional legibility.
- **Mesh Hydration**: Activates hybrid mesh states with ripple-safe hydration logic.
- **Fallback Narration**: Provides narratable defaults when data is missing or ambiguous.
- **Audit Logging**: Logs every mutation with contributor-readable summaries.

---

## Audit Summary (Sprint 5)

- ✅ Removed unused adapters and hydration stubs
- ✅ Refactored `hydrateMesh()` for emotional clarity and modular consequence
- ✅ Documented all manager methods with summary regions and tone previews
- ✅ Finalized onboarding notes for contributor safety and prefab alignment

---

## Usage

```ts
import { DataManager } from 'prism-os'

const mesh = DataManager.hydrateMesh(identity, traits, context)
