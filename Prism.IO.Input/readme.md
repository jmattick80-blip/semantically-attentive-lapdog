# Prism.IO.Input

## 🧠 Overview
`Prism.IO.Input` is a portable input abstraction layer designed to bridge external IO systems—such as Unity, Unreal, or custom simulation engines—with Prism’s emotionally scoped runtime. It provides a clean, engine-agnostic surface for contributor input mapping, intent routing, and envelope generation.

This module targets `.NETStandard 2.0` for maximum compatibility across platforms and is intended to remain prefab-safe, narratable, and contributor-aware.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Abstract input handling from external engines into Prism-compatible formats
- Define input schemas, binding contracts, and contributor-safe mappings
- Enable manifest-safe serialization and replayable input flows
- Interface with Prism’s `InputMap`, `RawInputDefinition`, and `IntentController`
