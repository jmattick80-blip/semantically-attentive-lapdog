# Prism.Internals.Orchestration

## ðŸ§  Overview
`Prism.Internals.Orchestration` coordinates emotional mesh behavior across simulation layers, contributor profiles, and consequence registries. It serves as the runtime conductor for initializing managers, collecting mesh profiles, and routing ripple events with emotional traceability.

This module ensures that mesh behavior remains narratable, extensible, and genre-safeâ€”whether used in simulation, multiplayer consequence flows, or audit tooling.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Collect contributor mesh profiles from adapters
- Initialize managers with emotionally scoped profile data
- Register mesh layers with consequence metadata and resistance profiles
- Emit and query ripple events for contributor traceability
- Prepare orchestrated flows for multiplayer, audit, and preview scenarios

## ðŸ§© Key Components
| File                    | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MeshCoordinator.cs`    | Orchestrates mesh behavior, logs ripple events, and initializes managers |
| `MeshLayerRegistry.cs`  | Registers mesh layers with emotional consequence metadata            |
| `MeshLayerState.cs`     | Represents individual layer configuration and ripple thresholds      |
| `Profiles/` *(Planned)* | Will define contributor-specific mesh modulation strategies          |

## ðŸ”— Relationships
- **`Shared.MeshLogic`** â†’ Defines mesh behavior contracts
- **`Internal.Mesh`** â†’ Executes runtime propagation
- **`Orchestration`** â†’ Coordinates behavior across profiles and layers
- **`Managers`** â†’ Initialized with mesh profiles for consequence routing
- **`Adapters`** â†’ Provide contributor mesh profiles for orchestration

---

## ðŸ§­ Sprint 5 Status
- âœ… `MeshCoordinator.cs` actively used in runtime
- âœ… `MeshLayerRegistry.cs` hydrated from config and prefab-safe
- ðŸŒŠ Ripple logging and contributor traceability implemented
- ðŸŸ¡ `Profiles/` folder presentâ€”awaiting contributor modulation strategies
- ðŸ§© Ready for deeper integration with trait activation, tone modulation, and multiplayer consequence

---

## ðŸ§¾ Onboarding Notes
- All orchestration logic must be narratable and emotionally scoped
- Mesh layer registration should include resistance profiles and consequence tags
- Ripple events must be logged with contributor ID and emotional timestamp
- Profiles should reflect contributor tone, phase, and ripple sensitivity
- Summary regions are recommended for all orchestrators and registries
